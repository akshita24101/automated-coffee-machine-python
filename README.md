# Automated Coffee Machine (Python OOP)

☕ A Python-based coffee machine simulation that combines object-oriented programming with user account handling, balance management, and persistent data storage.

## ✨ Features

1. **User Login**  
   - Users can log in with a username.  
   - If a username doesn’t exist, it is automatically created.

2. **Order Drinks**  
   - Users can order drinks like **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino**.

3. **User Balance Tracking**  
   - Each user has a personal wallet.  
   - Drink costs are automatically deducted after each order.

4. **Add Balance**  
   - Users can add money to their balance using a dedicated **"Add Balance"** option.  
   ✅ This allows uninterrupted coffee enjoyment even with low funds!

5. **Drink History**  
   - The system records how many times each drink was ordered per user.

6. **Inventory Management**  
   - The coffee machine keeps track of water, milk, and coffee stock.  
   - Admins can refill inventory when levels are low.

7. **Persistent Data Storage**  
   - All user balances and drink histories are saved in a `users.json` file.  
   - Data remains intact even after the program closes.

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements
1. Add a login system with passwords.
2. Implement admin privileges for inventory refill.
3. Include animations or sound effects during drink preparation.
4. Maintain detailed transaction logs and balance history per user.
